# TurkeyBot
Essentially I use my old PC to run game servers for my friends and I. The only problem is that I don't want to keep the servers running all the time but people wish to use them while I'm at work/uni, so TurkeyBot came to be. The bot basically just executes shell scripts on a CentOS server according to the command given.
